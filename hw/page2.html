    <p style="padding-right: 100px;padding-right: 0px;"> Blue-footed boobies are medium size birds found in Central and South American coasts - most in the Galapagos - that make use of their colorful feet! They use them to attract mates by doing a high-stomp strut and when they have babies, the parents keep them warm by covering them with the webbed feet. </p>
