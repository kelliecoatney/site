    <p style="padding-right: 100px;padding-right: 0px;"> Pangolins are basically scaly anteaters. They are the only mammals completely covered in protective scales, which they curl up into a ball for the scales to act as armor. Sadly, their meat is considered a delicacy and they are one of the most trafficked and poached animals in the world. </p>
