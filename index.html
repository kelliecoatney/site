        <p>Hello ~ <br><br>
            Iâ€™m Kellie Coatney and this is my home base online! On the navigation bar you can see my current projects for my Introduction to Web-Based Art class, and down below you can find a link to my first web-related project.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for who I am regarding my art... I am all over the place. I am in an experimental phase where I am trying anything and everything. Digital art is my current love and a lot of my current work is based on creating patterns and surface designs. Aesthetically, I like to keep bright colors and topics, with my inner love for the mysterious and vintage coming through sometimes. Other areas of art I explore are painting, graphic design, and illustration. I tend to be interested in a little bit of everything, and I aim to be a jack of all trades to keep up with it all.
